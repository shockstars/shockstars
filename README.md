**rewriting all of this be patient.**

DID is often misrepresented online and sometimes dumbed down to the "people in my head" disorder. I hope to educate everyone on what this disorder and how disabling it can be.

<summary>What is DID?</summary>

> Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is a complex dissociative disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct identity states, also known as alters. Additional symptoms include dissociation, memory gaps, identity confusion or an unstable sense of self, emotional dysregulation, and other mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. These symptoms must not be the result of another medical condition, substance or drug use, or culturally accepted religious practices. DID is frequently seen in individuals who have experienced chronic and complex trauma and may be influenced by disorganized attachment to caregivers during early childhood, typically before the age of 9. Other disorders, including psychotic disorders, borderline personality disorder, and maladaptive daydreaming, can sometimes be mistaken for DID. Historical accounts of cases resembling DID date back to the sixteenth century, when such cases were often interpreted as possession.
